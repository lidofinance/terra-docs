# Roadmap

We are currently working on: 

* Implementing a user-friendly way to claim MIR, ANC and other on-going airdrops (including previously distributed tokens) for stLuna and bLuna holders;
* Introducing a zero-slippage pool for bLuna <> stLuna swaps, and a metastable pool that continuously pegs to the Hub's stLuna <> Luna exchange rate to improve trade execution and liquidity.
* Making all contracts pausable to increase security.
